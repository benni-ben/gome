This is a very robust game website, with a lot of cool features.

 - Game thumbnails. 
 - Game descriptions.
 - Easy game adding. 
 - Easy file structure.
 - AND MORE.

## Development

This is made with CSS, HTML, and pure JavaScript. For the fonts, file-embedded base64 encoded fonts are used. A JSON file is used for the game paths and descriptions. The file is named `descriptions.json`.

The JSON file structure is simply composed of 2 parameters for each game: game name, and game description.

The key is the game's name(must be the exact name used in the path), and the description can be whatever you want it to be. Please note that every description must have a game, and every game must have a description.

## Adding game

To add a game, you have to first create a folder inside of the `assets` folder.
